* My Emacs configuration
There's probably nothing super exciting here, but if you find something you need, great.
Bits and pieces are mostly collected from all over the web, by googling solutions to my problems, and finding interesting things to try. 

The main config file, =conf.org=, is written in =org-mode=, following guidelines of litereate programming, more or less.

Occasionally I might put stuff I'm not gonna try right away here. Those are marked with tag =disabled=, and org-babel doesn't tangle those source blocks. This way I can easily find them and try them out when I feel like doing so.
This config is a work in progress. Needs organizing, cleaning and other things.
